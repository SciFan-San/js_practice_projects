Beware all who enter, ahead lies chaos and madness, a place devoid of raitonality and function!  
  
Dramatics aside, I welcome you to the place where I practice JavaScript. I made this repo for that primary reason, practice. The secondary reason is that by leveragin the power of git and GitHub my practice isn't bound to a single machine. Thirdly, for better or worse I've decided to make my foray into understanding and pushing the limits of JS open for all to see.  
  
Feel free to copy any code your find will help you in your journey with JS. Also feel free to open issues if you have any constructive criticisms of my code and such or if you have any questions for me. I won't promise that I'll address absolutely everything but feedback is usually helpful and I'm here for that.  

P.S. Just saying the quiet part out loud here, but any unnecessary badgering or destructive criticism or generally toxic behaviour will routinely be ignored. I don't have the sanity to spare for such things. Beyond this little tidbit, I hope you learn much in your JS journey too!
